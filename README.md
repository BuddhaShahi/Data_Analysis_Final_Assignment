# ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µ Nepal Earthquake Data Analysis (2015â€“2025)

This project presents a complete data analysis and visualization of earthquake events in Nepal from 2015 to 2025. The original dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sangampaudel530/nepal-earthquake-2015-2025/notebook), cleaned, and analyzed to extract meaningful insights about seismic activity in Nepal, especially focusing on the major Gorkha Earthquake of 2015.

##  Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle - [Nepal Earthquake 2015â€“2025](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sangampaudel530/nepal-earthquake-2015-2025/notebook)
- **File Used**: `cleaned_nepal_earthquake.csv`
- **Cleaning Steps**:
  - Removed empty rows and shells
  - Merged `Date` and `Time` into a new `Datetime` column
  - Set `Datetime` as the index for time-based analysis

---

##  Analysis Performed

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Calculated mean, min, and max earthquake magnitudes
- Analyzed year-wise and month-wise trends
- Created histograms for magnitude distribution
- Generated heatmaps and correlation matrices

### Spatial Insights
- Mapped locations using latitude and longitude
- Visualized earthquake hotspots (Bagmati Province being most frequent)
- Scatter plots to analyze location vs magnitude/depth

###  Temporal Insights
- Identified 2015 as the year with the most activity (Gorkha Earthquake)
- Detected seasonal/monthly spikes (Aprilâ€“May 2015, Jan 2025)

---

## Key Findings

- **Average Magnitude**: ~4.47
- **Strongest Quake**: Magnitude 7.8 in 2015
- **Most Active Year**: 2015, with over 120 quakes
- **Hotspot**: Central Nepal (Bagmati Province)
- **Pattern**: Most quakes between 4.0â€“5.0, few extreme events

## Suggestions & Preparedness Plan

To reduce risks in high-impact zones like Bagmati Province:

-  **Early Warning Systems**
-  **Stricter Building Codes**
-  **Public Awareness Campaigns**
-  **Emergency Disaster Teams & Drills**
-  **Resilient Infrastructure**
-  **Continuous Monitoring & Research**

---

##  Conclusion

This project shows how data can guide disaster management and preparedness. By learning from the past and acting now, Nepal can become more resilient to future seismic events.

---

##  Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Markdown** for reporting

---

##  Output Files

- `cleaned_nepal_earthquake.csv` â€“ Cleaned dataset
- `correlation_matrix_heatmap.png` â€“ Heatmap image
- Final graphs (scatter, histogram, boxplot, etc.)

##  Authorâ€™s Note

This project was created with the goal of understanding Nepalâ€™s seismic patterns and preparing useful insights for future disaster response. The lessons of the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake remind us to always be ready, together we can build a safer future.
